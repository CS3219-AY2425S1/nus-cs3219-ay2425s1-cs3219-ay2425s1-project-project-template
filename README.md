- In the latter scenario, you should enable sub-modules on this GitHub classroom repository to manage the development/deployment **AND** add your mentor to the individual repositories as a collaborator.
- The teaching team should be given access to the repositories as we may require viewing the history of the repository in case of any disputes or disagreements.
