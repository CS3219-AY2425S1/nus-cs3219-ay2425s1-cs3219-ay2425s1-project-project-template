### Note:

-   You can choose to develop individual microservices within separate folders within this repository **OR** use individual repositories (all public) for each microservice.
-   In the latter scenario, you should enable sub-modules on this GitHub classroom repository to manage the development/deployment **AND** add your mentor to the individual repositories as a collaborator.
-   The teaching team should be given access to the repositories as we may require viewing the history of the repository in case of any disputes or disagreements.
