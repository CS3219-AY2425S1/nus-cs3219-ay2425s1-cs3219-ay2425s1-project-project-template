# Documentation for Collaboration Service

## Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/collab`.

## Authentication 

All API endpoints require a valid JWT token attained from our user service.

This should be done under the headers['authorization'] in the form "Bearer userJWT".

This applies for the initial 'connection' event for our socket.io as well.

## API Endpoints

### GET `/check-session/`

Checks if a user is part of an active session.

- **Response**:

  - **200 OK**: Returns session details.

  ```json

    "questionId": "questionId123"
  }
  ```

  - **400 Bad Request**: Returns an error if the user ID is not provided.


## Socket.IO Events

The socket path is '/api/collab/socket.io'.

### Example Usage of Socket.IO Events

```javascript
// Example of joining a session
socket.emit('join-session', {
  sessionId: 'abc123',
  userId: 'user1',
  matchedUserId: 'user2',
});

// Listening for updated code
socket.on('code-updated', (newCode) => {
  console.log('Code has been updated:', newCode);
});
```
